<h3>Project History</h3>
<p>The goal of Stationers&rsquo; Register Online is to create a searchable database of all the copy-entries recorded in the Stationers&rsquo; Register. The project began in 2011 when Giles Bergel received a grant from the University of Oxford&rsquo;s JPR Lyell Fund to produce digital transcriptions of the two series of edited volumes of the Stationers&rsquo; Register - Arber, and Eyre and Rivington (see Bibliography), which span the Register period from 1557 until 1708. Copies of these pioneering works, long out of copyright, had been scanned and placed online by Columbia University Library [link] and the University of Toronto, respectively [link].</p>

<p>The 2011 project team (Bergel, Ian Gadd (Bath Spa University), James Cummings (University of Oxford, IT Services) and Pip Willcox (Bodleian Librariesy, University of Oxford) &nbsp;created XML transcripts of both series, using a combination of OCR and manual keyboarding by a specialist firm, Invida Solutions. The resulting XML transcript preserved Arber&rsquo;s own typographical conventions (followed by Eyre and Rivington) that identified members of the Stationers&rsquo; Company, or attempted to indicate the titles of works given in entries. These editions&rsquo; notes on many entries were also retained (Arber&rsquo;s notes on individual entries are displayed in the current version of Stationers&rsquo; Register Online): otherwise, all content and commentary not present in the original Registers was omitted from the XML transcripts. </p>

<h3>Editorial </h3>
<p>Stationers&rsquo; Register Online is a record of the copy-entries, both cancelled and uncancelled, made in the series of volumes now generally known as the Stationers&rsquo; Register. While the earlier volumes, in particular, contain much else that is of interest to scholars of the Company (such as notes of fines, drafts of entrances made elsewhere, membership records and sundry Company accounts and memoranda), SRO covers only those entries made in the Register for the purposes of recording permission to publish. It is therefore not a facsimile edition of either the Register or Arber, but a new reference work that incorporates elements of both sources, with additional editorial notes and a new system of SROID numbers for ease of reference. Future versions will include additional references, especially to bibliographical and biographical resources for the study of the book trade, and commentary. </p>

<p>Each entry from the project&rsquo;s Arber XML transcript has been proofed and corrected against digital images of the original Register (these images are available through AM). Although Arber&rsquo;s transcript was of a high standard and some of his conventions (chiefly, his expansion of abbreviations) have been retained, SRO corrects or otherwise diverges from Arber in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>The fraudulent additions to the original Register made by John Payne Collier (1789-1883) &nbsp;to entries between 1579 and 1594, present in Arber, have been removed. For a list and discussion of these additions see Freeman, A and J in the Bibliography.</li>
<li>Marginal initials and notes made by George Steevens (1736-1800) on Shakespeare and other [CHECK] entries have been excised.</li>
<li>Cancelled Register text not given in Arber has been supplied. This often consists merely of scribal errors, but cancelled names and their substitutes sometimes reveal a pattern of entrance and almost immediate transfer of copies: the editors are grateful to Peter Blayney for alerting us to the meaning of this practice. </li>
<li>Marginalia not given in Arber has usually been supplied, apart from occasional running tallies of fees made by the Company Clerk that do not relate to individual entries [give location]</li>
<li>Scribal graphs for capital-F (Unicode: U+FB00); th (00FE) and long-s (U+017F), inconsistently rendered in Arber, have been transliterated to their closest modern equivalents. SRO otherwise reverts to the Register&rsquo;s original capitalisation and spelling.</li>
<li>Annotations in either the Register or Arber that appear to apply to more than one entry have been applied as Notes to each to ensure they are visible at all times.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Dates</em></p>
<p>It is not until the 1570s that the Stationers&rsquo; Company&rsquo;s Clerk systematically dated entries made in the Register. Some earlier entries were given specific dates, but the vast majority of entries made up to 1571 were grouped only by the Company&rsquo;s year. </p>

<p>It cannot be assumed that entries were always entered in date sequence, even once specific dates are supplied, as it is not clear exactly how or when the Clerk wrote up the entries. For all dated entries, SRO uses the Clerk&rsquo;s dates as written even where it seems entirely possible that these are wrong as there are occasions where entries do seem to have been genuinely entered out of chronological order. However, for earlier years where dates are rarely supplied we have provided date-spans that assume chronological sequence: i.e. an undated entry between two dated entries is presumed to have been entered between those two dates.</p>

<p><em>Names</em></p>
<p>All names, whether of individuals or fictional characters, are searchable and browsable under their original spellings within the Register. A future version of this resource will include name authorities for members of the book trade; licensers; and other persons commonly named within the Register. Members of the Stationers&rsquo; Company are attributed, and searches and browses can distinguish them from all other names. Names of persons entering copies are recorded and may be searched.</p>

<p>The Master and Wardens of the Company at the time of each entrance are given in the metadata for each entry. </p>

<p>Copy-Titles</p>
<p>The Register&rsquo;s delineation of the title of the copy to be entered may closely follow the title of a work as published, but it is often very unclear what title (if any) the enterer had in mind. SRO demarcates all of the entry-text that appears to describe the title of the work - even if it is fragmentary - but users must be aware that the title of a work as published in a specific edition may differ markedly from the form of words given in the Register. Future versions of this resource may attempt to link Register entrances to bibliographic records, as has been conjectured in STC and sources such as Rollins and Greg [or DEEP]</p>

<p>Entry Types/Status</p>
<p>SRO assigns entries to one or more types. </p>
<ul>
<li>Entered. The default type.</li>
<li>Assigned. An entrance apparently made over from one enterer to another.</li>
<li>Stock. An entrance made on behalf of one of the official Company joint stocks, such as the English or Latin Stock.</li>
<li>Incomplete. An entrance lacks a standard feature such as the name of an enterer, or a copy-title [FEE?]</li>
<li>Cancelled. The entry is entirely crossed-out.</li>
<li>Other. </li>
</ul>

<p>Fees</p>
<p>Fees are summed and listed in the metadata [give fee standards]. Arber&rsquo;s comments on fees are often of interest, and show if a fee may have been miscalculated or does not appear to correspond to the standard rates.</p>

<p>Arber reference</p>
<p>The page(s) of Arber in which an entry appears. </p>

<p>Register reference</p>
<p>The folio(s) or page(s) of the original Register. The foliation of the Register is occasionally erroneous: this has been noted.</p>

<p>[Do we retain image IDnos in the metadata? They look really ugly] &nbsp;</p>
